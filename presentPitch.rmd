## This application using Linear regression to predict the ozone levels based on different parameters


## Data used

the data used for this app is the airQuality data from the datasets package in R.
the model will predict ozone levels based on Temperature, Solar Radiation, and other factors.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(datasets)
```

## Description
The data is as shown: 
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
head(airquality)
```

## The application uses simple Linear regression to identify the trend between target and predictor variables and thus establish a linear relation used to predict new values.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = airquality)
plot(model)
```
